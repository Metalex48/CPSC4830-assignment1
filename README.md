# CPSC4830-assignment1-
This first assignment for CPSC 4830 is to practice the usage of linear and logistic regression using SciKit Learn.

The first part of the assignment is about linear regression. We are trying to predict the price of a house using the California Housing dataset from SciKit-Learn. For this task we follow the next steps:
  1- Explore, clean and transform our data.
  2- Create a simple linear regression model.
  3- Enhance the model with some of SciKit-Learn tools like Cross Validation, applying different regularization techniques, and using Grid Search to fine tune the model.
  
The second part of the assignment pertains logistic regression. Similarly, we first explore and clean the data. We then proceed to create the model and explore the usage of different number of K in K-cross validation.
